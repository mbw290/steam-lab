            Welcome to Mr. Reed's STEAM Lab! We are excited to share what we've created with you and your students.
            Joe and Tish Reed are retired educators with over 60 years experience between them.
            They share a passion for anything and everything science. Joe loves to ignite the curiosity of students with hands-on,
            inquiry-based explorations and Tish loves to find ways to integrate science into all subject areas.
            Joe and Tish have compiled STEAM challenges and activities to support classroom teachers and Expanded Learning facilitators.
            Consideration has been made for ease of finding materials and the goal is that activities can be completed easily.
            Step-by-step instructions are given in the videos. Some videos also contain a literature or art component.
            Along with each video there is a “Teacher Resources” document. The resources include links to non-fiction text and additional videos,
            and where applicable, math, art, and music activities. There are numerous resources online,
            but our goal was to gather a few resources to help teachers support and extend the STEAM lesson videos,
            without them having to take the time to do hours of searching on their own.

              <p className='mission__section-heading'>What is Learning Loss?</p>
              <p>Almost everything that researchers know that affects learning indicates that children may have deficits due to Covid-19 educational changes.
              Time on task, online learning, absenteeism, and summer learning loss all create a need for intervention and the challenge of bringing students
              back up to grade level.</p>

              <p className='mission__section-heading'>Addressing Learning Loss</p>
              <p>A study at the University of Michigan looked at learning loss and how to remediate. One of the primary goals was to increase student engagement. 
              The methodology was project based instruction. This is an approach to education in which students explore academic subjects through meaningful
              explorations that pique their interests as they seek to solve real-world problems. After receiving project-based instruction,
              the University of Michigan researchers found that second grade students gained five to six months learning in social studies and two months in
              informational reading. Included in these groups were students from low-income backgrounds and from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>Mr Reed's STEAM Lab video program poses real world challenges and asks students to come up with creative ways to solve these problems.
              Once the students are engaged, the teacher has access to links for over eighty-five informational texts. Students are eager to engage in these
              non-fiction texts because they have been so motivated by the high interest challenges.</p>

              <p>Mr Reed's STEAM Lab video program allows schools and teachers to decide how they best want to approach the issue of learning loss.
              Some researchers feel that students should be presented  grade level material and moved forward. Other philosophies suggest that students
              need to fill in gaps missed during distance learning by providing material from previous years. Mr Reed's STEAM Lab video program provides
              flexibility in that they may be used to address both philosophies.</p>

              <p className='mission__section-heading'>Transforming Classrooms, Schools, and Lives</p>
              <p>English Language learners consist of a diverse group of students who typically lack access to Science,
              Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) opportunities. A new report by the National Academies of Sciences
              and Engineering states that a shift is needed in how STEM is taught to English Learners.</p>

              <p>Often these students are denied access to STEM learning opportunities. The report states that language and
              content are learned concurrently and not separately or consecutively. As such, English Learners need STEM
              experiences early in their education when their peers are gaining exposure to STEM content. The suggestion is
              that curriculum developers should work to develop materials and resources that target English Language Learners.
              With appropriate curriculum, these students can participate, contribute and succeed in STEM classrooms.</p>

              <p>Education Week reported in 2018 that school systems across the country should do more to ensure that current
              and former English-language learners have access to STEM education. “Too often schools operate under the incorrect
              assumption that proficiency in English is a prerequisite to meaningful engagement with STEM learning and fail to
              leverage ELs meaningful engagement with content and disciplinary practices as a route to language proficiency,”
              the report authors wrote. The study also found that, “Recognition of the assets that ELs bring to the classroom,
              and that some deficits in student performance arise from lack of access rather than limited ability or language
              proficiency, or from cultural differences.</p>

              <p>EdSurge research found that obstacles to English learners participating in STEM subjects and careers do not
              include lack of interest or ability, according to the report, “English Learners in STEM Subjects: Transforming
              Classrooms, Schools and Lives.” Rather, it stems from a lack of access to rigorous, age-appropriate instruction
              in the field. The problem can be attributed to a variety of reasons; one is that many schools assume English
              learners cannot participate in rigorous STEM content learning before reaching a certain level of English
              proficiency—an assumption that research has disproven, according to the authors.</p>

              <p>Mr Reed's Steam Lab video challenges are designed to give an immersive experience that EL students can access,
              enjoy, and in which they can experience success.  Each activity is designed with a specific grade level in mind,
              however teachers may use their discretion when it comes to assigning or using the videos. Many of the literacy
              resources may be adjusted for different levels of reading ability.</p>
